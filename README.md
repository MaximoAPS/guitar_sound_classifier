# guitar_sound_classifier
This code defines a dataset and model for classifying guitar sounds as either acoustic or electric based on spectrograms and MFCC features. The dataset loads .wav files and extracts the spectrogram, mel spectrogram, and MFCC features to form a 3-channel image. The model uses convolutional and linear layers to classify the guitar sound images.
